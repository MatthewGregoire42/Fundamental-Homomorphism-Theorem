\section{Groups}

First, here are the basic preliminaries we need to start talking about groups.

\begin{definition}
\label{binaryoperation}
Let $G$ be a set. A \textbf{binary operation} on $G$ is a function $*: G \times G \to G$.
\end{definition}

If in $G$, we have $*(a, b) = c$, we often write $a * b = c$. In fact, we can often drop the operation symbol and write this as $ab = c$, if no confusion will result. For now, we'll continue explicitly writing the operation for clarity.


\begin{definition}
A \textbf{group} is a set G with a binary operation $*: G \times G \to G$ that satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There exists an element $e \in G$ such that, for all $a \in G$, $a*e = e*a = a$. Here $e$ is referred to as the \textbf{identity element} for $*$.
    \item For all $a \in G$, there exists an $\inv{a} \in G$ such that $a*\inv{a} = \inv{a}*a = e$. We call $\inv{a}$ the \textbf{inverse} of $a$.
    \item For all $a, b, c \in G$, $a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c$. In this case, we say $*$ is an \textbf{associative} operation.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

We'll give a few examples of groups to get a feel for their structure.

\begin{example}
The integers $\z$ under the usual addition ($+$) form a group. The element $0$ acts as the identity, and for any $a \in \z$, $-a$ acts as its additive inverse. Addition is associative, so this is indeed a group. For similar reasons, the sets $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{C}$ are also groups under addition.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The integers $\zn[n]$ of remainders modulo $n$ also form a group under addition. We'll be pedantically formal here for the sake of demonstrating the group axioms. The elements of $\zn[n]$ are defined as the integers $x$ such that $0 \leq x < n$, and addition within $\zn[n]$, for now given the symbol $\tilde +$, is defined as follows: if $a + b = nq + r$ in $\z$ by the division algorithm, then $a \np b = r$. Since $0 \leq r < n$, this is also an element of $\zn[n]$, so this is a well-defined binary operation.

$0$ is again the identity, because $a + 0 = 0 + a = n\cdot 0 + a$, so $a \np 0 = 0 \np a = a$. Also, the equation $a + (n-a) = (n-a) + a = n\cdot 1 + 0$ shows that $n-a$ is the inverse of $a$. Finally, to show associativity, just note that $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$ is true for any integers $a$, $b$, and $c$, so therefore adding any elements $a, b, c \in \zn[n]$ must yield the same remainder.
\end{example}

Whew! Most of the time there's no need to be that formal. The groups $\zn[n]$ are rather intuitive, so there's no need to get bogged down in this formalism. The real punchline is that this set of numbers is a group, and operating within $\zn[n]$ should naturally feel like operating on congruence classes of integers modulo $n$.

In order to tackle the fundamental homomorphism theorem, we need to first build up a litte machinery in order to understand groups. The next few theorems build only from the definition of a group.

\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be a group with a binary operation $*$. Then for all $a, b, c \in G$, $a * b = a * c$ implies that $b = c$, and $b*a = c*a$ also implies $b=c$. These are called the \textbf{left and right cancellation laws}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $a*b = a*c$. We know there exists $\inv{a} \in G$, so therefore:

\begin{center}
    $\inv{a} * (a*b) = \inv{a} * (a*c)$
\end{center}

By the associative property:

\begin{center}
    $(\inv{a} * a) * b = (\inv{a} * a) * c$
\end{center}

By definition of $\inv{a}$:

\begin{center}
    $e * b = e * c$
\end{center}

And finally, by definition of $e$, we have $b = c$. Similarly, if $b*a = c*a$, then $(b*a)*\inv{a} = (c*a)*\inv{a}$. Therefore $b*(a*\inv{a}) = c*(a*\inv{a})$, and $b*e = c*e$, or $b = c$.

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be a group. There is a unique identity element $e \in G$ such that $e*a = a*e = a$ for all $a \in G$. Similarly, for $a \in G$, there is a unique element $\inv{a} \in G$ such that $a*\inv{a} = \inv{a}*a = e$. Also $\left(\inv{a}\right)^{-1} = a$, that is, the inverse of $\inv a$ is $a$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $e$ and $e'$ are both elements of $G$ with the given property. Then we have $e = e*e'$, using $e'$ as the identity. But we also have $e*e' = e'$, using $e$ as the identity. Therefore $e = e'$.

Now let $a \in G$. If $a*\inv{a} = \inv{a}*a = e$, and also $a*\inv{\tilde{a}} = \inv{\tilde{a}}*a = e$, then we have:

\begin{center}
    $a*\inv{a} = e = a*{\inv{\tilde{a}}}$
\end{center}

And by cancellation, $\inv{a} = \inv{\tilde{a}}$. For the last property, we only need to note that $\left(\inv{a}\right)^{-1}$ is (by definition) the unique element in $G$ such that $\left(\inv{a}\right)^{-1} * \inv{a} = \inv{a} * \left(\inv{a}\right)^{-1} = e$. By the equation $a * \inv{a} = \inv{a} * a = e$, we see that this unique element is indeed $a$.

\end{proof}

Now, most operations we're familiar with aren't just associative. They have other nice properties as well. The next few definitions solidify this conceptually.

\begin{definition}
Let $*$ be a binary operation on a set $A$. \extra If for all $a, b \in A$, we have $a * b$ = $b * a$, then $*$ is a \textbf{commutative} operation.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $G$ be a group with a binary operation $*$. \extra If $*$ is commutative, then $G$ is an \textbf{abelian group}. Otherwise, $G$ is \textbf{non-abelian}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
The familiar properties of integer addition show that $\z$ and $\zn[n]$ for any $n$ are abelian groups.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $F$ be the set of all invertible functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, and consider the operation of function composition defined on $F$. Here $i(x) = x$ serves as the identity function, and each function in $F$ has an inverse in $F$ by construction. Function composition is associative as well. Finally, if $f, g \in F$, then $\inv{(f \circ g)} = \inv g \circ \inv f$, because: 
\begin{align*}
\left[(f \circ g) \circ \left(\inv g \circ \inv f\right)\right]x &= f\left(g\left(\inv g\left(\inv f \left(x\right)\right)\right)\right) \\
 &= f\left(\left(g \circ \inv g\right)\left(\inv f(x)\right)\right) \\
 &= f\left(i\left(\inv f(x)\right)\right) \\
 &= \left(f \circ \inv f\right)(x) \\
 &= i(x)\mathrm{,}
\end{align*}
which is the identity map. It can be similarly shown that $\inv g \circ \inv f$ is the left inverse of $f \circ g$ as well. Therefore $F$ forms a group under function composition. Take $f(x) = x+1$ and $g(x) = x^3$. Both of these are invertible functions. We also see that $(f \circ g)(x) = x^3 + 1$, while $(g \circ f)(x) = (x+1)^3$. Therefore $F$ is not an abelian group.
\end{example}
