\section{Introduction}

While taking an undergraduate abstract algebra class, the most confusing topic for me was the fundamental homomorphism theorem for groups, otherwise known as the first isomorphism theorem. This result is quite elegant, but looking back I'm shocked at how poorly it was explained in my textbook. This is meant to be a document to build straight up to this theorem from basic definitions.
