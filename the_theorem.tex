\section{Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem}

Now we finally have built all the machinery we need to tackle this theorem. The statement is as follows.

\begin{theorem}[The Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem]
Let $\phi: G \to G'$ be a group homomorphism with kernel $K$. Then $\mu: G/K \to \phi(G)$ defined by $\mu(aK) = \phi(a)$ is an isomorphism. If $\gamma: G \to G/K$ is the canonical homomorphism given by $\gamma(a) = aK$, then $\phi(a) = \mu(\gamma(a))$ for all $a \in G$.
\end{theorem}
