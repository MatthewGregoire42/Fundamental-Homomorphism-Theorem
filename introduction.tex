\section{Introduction}

The goal of this document is to introduce the reader to the fundamental homomorphism theorem for groups, starting from basic definitions. This result is sometimes otherwise known as the first isomorphism theorem. It's quite an elegant piece of mathematics, but looking back I was shocked at how poorly it was explained in my textbook. To achieve this goal, we proceed at a breakneck pace most of the way through. If this is your first exposure to this material, make sure to take time to digest each result.

This document is designed for a reader who has the sole objective of understanding the reasoning behind this theorem, and therefore its scope is narrow. However, we would be missing many fundamental (and beautiful) facts about the basics of  group theory if we focus only on the necessary and sufficient definitions and theorems. Therefore we'll motivate these concepts with several examples, and also present some results that aren't strictly required. \extra The examples are clearly labeled if you don't care to read them, and unnecessary results are marked with a spade in the left margin, as shown in this sentence.
