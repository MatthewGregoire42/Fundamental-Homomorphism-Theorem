\section{Introduction}

While taking an undergraduate abstract algebra class, the most confusing topic for me was the fundamental homomorphism theorem for groups, otherwise known as the first isomorphism theorem. This result is quite elegant, but looking back I'm shocked at how poorly it was explained in my textbook. This is meant to be a document to build straight up to this theorem from basic definitions.

This document is designed for a reader who has the sole objective of understanding the reasoning behind this theorem, and therefore its scope is narrow. However, we would be missing many fundamental (and beautiful) facts about the basics of  group theory if we focus only on the necessary and sufficient definitions and theorems. Therefore we'll motivate these concepts with several examples, and also present some results that aren't strictly required. \extra The examples are clearly labeled if you don't care to read them, and unnecessary results are marked with a star in the left margin, as shown in this sentence.
